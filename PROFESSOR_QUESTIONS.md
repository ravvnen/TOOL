# Questions to Get Useful Feedback from Your Professor

## The Problem

Your professor isn't a technical expert in event sourcing or LLMs. This means:
- He can't tell you if your architecture is good
- He CAN tell you if your thesis structure is sound
- He CAN tell you if your contribution is clear
- He CAN tell you what he'll be looking for when grading

Your job: **Ask questions he can actually answer.**

## Questions to Ask (In Order of Priority)

### 1. Scope & Expectations

> "I've built a working system with 5 testable hypotheses. From a thesis evaluation perspective, does this seem like appropriate scope - too small, too large, or about right?"

**Why ask this:** He knows what other master's theses look like. He can calibrate.

---

### 2. Contribution Clarity

> "My main contribution is applying event sourcing to LLM instruction memory. Is that framing clear to you, or do I need to explain the novelty differently?"

**Why ask this:** If he doesn't understand the contribution, neither will the examiner. Fix the explanation now.

---

### 3. Evaluation Rigor

> "I'm planning to test 5 hypotheses with human evaluation and automated metrics. What aspects of evaluation methodology do you typically look for in a strong thesis?"

**Why ask this:** He's seen many theses. He knows what weak evaluation looks like.

---

### 4. Writing Priorities

> "I have about 10 weeks for writing. Which chapters do you think deserve the most attention - Background, Design, Evaluation, or Discussion?"

**Why ask this:** Different supervisors value different things. Find out what he cares about.

---

### 5. Red Flags

> "Is there anything in what I've shown you today that concerns you or that you'd want me to address before submission?"

**Why ask this:** Better to know now than in the final feedback.

---

### 6. Grading Criteria

> "What would differentiate an 'excellent' thesis from a 'good' thesis in your evaluation?"

**Why ask this:** Direct insight into how to get a top grade.

---

### 7. Related Work

> "Are there any researchers or papers in this area you think I should definitely cite?"

**Why ask this:** He might know the field broadly even if not deeply.

---

## How to Handle His Responses

### If he says "looks good" without detail:

Push back gently:
> "I appreciate that - but I really want to make this excellent. If you had to pick one area that could be stronger, what would it be?"

### If he seems unsure about the technical parts:

Redirect to what he CAN evaluate:
> "I understand the technical details are specialized. From a thesis structure and academic rigor perspective, does the approach make sense?"

### If he raises a concern:

Don't defend. Ask for specifics:
> "That's helpful feedback. Can you tell me more about what specifically concerns you, so I can address it?"

### If he says it's too complex:

Clarify:
> "Do you mean the system is too complex to explain clearly, or that I'm trying to do too much for a master's thesis?"

## After the Meeting

Immediately write down:
1. His main feedback points
2. Any concerns he raised
3. What he said about grading criteria
4. Any papers/researchers he mentioned

Then message me and we'll adjust the plan based on his feedback.

## Remember

Your professor WANTS you to succeed. He's not trying to trick you or find problems. He's trying to help you produce a good thesis.

But he can only help if you ask the right questions.

**Your job tomorrow: Extract actionable feedback, not just validation.**
