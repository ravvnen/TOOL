🏗️ TOOL System: Clean Modular Architecture
📋 Architecture Overview
Your TOOL system now follows a feature-based modular architecture that balances clean architecture principles with practical development needs. The structure organizes code by business capabilities rather than technical layers.

🎯 Core Design Principles
1. Vertical Slicing by Business Capability
Each module represents a complete business feature with everything it needs:

Controllers (HTTP endpoints)
Business logic services
DTOs and models
Feature-specific utilities
2. Clear Dependency Direction
3. Separation of Concerns
What the system does (Modules)
How it does it technically (Infrastructure)
How everything is wired together (Configuration)
📁 Detailed Structure Breakdown
/Modules/ - Business Features
Each module is a self-contained vertical slice representing one business capability:

AgentOperations/ - Agent API Interface
Purpose: Provides the /agent/{ns}/* API that agent containers use to:

Retrieve memory (/memory)
Check health (/health)
Process chat requests (/chat)
Debug agent state (/debug/items, /state)
MemoryManagement/ - Memory Compilation Engine
Purpose: Handles the core memory system:

API endpoints: /api/v1/compile-memory, /api/v1/search, /api/v1/state, /api/v1/why
Business logic: FTS5 search, relevance scoring, memory JSON compilation
Integration: Works with both AgentController and direct API consumers
SeedProcessing/ - Webhook & Data Ingestion
Purpose: Handles all data ingestion:

Webhook processing: GitHub webhooks, manual seeding
Event generation: Creates evt.seed.proposal.v1 events
Data validation: Ensures proper structure and provenance
DeltaProjection/ - Event Processing Pipeline
Purpose: Maintains the projection (current state):

Event consumption: Processes DELTA events from NATS
Database updates: Updates im_items_current and im_items_history
FTS5 indexing: Maintains full-text search indexes
Promotion/ - Event Promotion Logic
Purpose: Implements the promotion pipeline:

Event evaluation: Decides promote/defer/skip for proposals
Business rules: Implements promotion policies
DELTA emission: Creates DELTA events for accepted proposals
/Infrastructure/ - Technical Platform
Provides cross-cutting technical capabilities that modules depend on:

Database/ - Data Persistence Layer
Purpose: Handles all database concerns:

Connection management: Thread-safe SQLite connections
Schema initialization: Creates tables, indexes, triggers
Migration support: Handles schema evolution
Messaging/ - Event Streaming Platform
Purpose: Manages event streaming infrastructure:

Stream creation: Sets up EVENTS and DELTAS streams
Configuration: Handles NATS JetStream policies
Reliability: Ensures message durability and ordering
/Configuration/ - Composition Root
ServiceConfiguration.cs - Central dependency injection setup:

Responsibilities:

Service registration: Wires up all dependencies
Lifetime management: Configures singletons, scoped, transient
Cross-cutting concerns: CORS, hosted services, HTTP clients
🔄 Data Flow & Interactions
1. Webhook Ingestion Flow
2. Agent Query Flow
3. Direct API Flow
🎯 Architectural Benefits
For Development
✅ Easy Navigation: "Need memory stuff? Look in /Modules/MemoryManagement/"
✅ Clear Ownership: Each module has obvious responsibilities
✅ Independent Evolution: Modules can change without affecting others
✅ Onboarding: New developers can understand one module at a time
For Testing
✅ Module Isolation: Each module can be unit tested independently
✅ Mock Infrastructure: Infrastructure can be mocked/stubbed easily
✅ Integration Testing: Clear boundaries for integration test scope
For Thesis Defense
✅ Professional Structure: Demonstrates architectural thinking
✅ Easy Explanation: Clear story from business problem to technical solution
✅ Scalability: Shows how system could grow with new modules
✅ Maintainability: Demonstrates long-term thinking
For Future Development
✅ MCP Server (v4.0): New module in /Modules/McpIntegration/
✅ Admin CRUD (v5.0): New module in /Modules/Administration/
✅ RAG Features (v3.0): Extend /Modules/MemoryManagement/
