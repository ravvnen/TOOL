# Changes: v1 → v2 (Shorter Opening)

## What Changed

**Only the opening paragraph** was split into **2 shorter paragraphs** for better readability.

---

## v1 Opening (180 words, 1 paragraph)

❌ **Too long** - one massive block

> Imagine two software developers, Alice and Bob, working in the same repository with AI-powered coding assistants. Alice asks her agent, "What logging format should we use for error handling?" and receives advice to implement structured JSON logs with timestamp fields and severity levels. Ten minutes later, Bob poses the same question to his agent and is told to use traditional printf-style logs with simple string formatting. Both responses are technically correct in general contexts, but the result is inconsistent practices across the codebase. When a third developer reviews the code, they find two conflicting logging approaches with no documentation explaining the team's actual decision. This scenario, while seemingly minor, illustrates a fundamental challenge in deploying large language model (LLM) agents in multi-agent or team environments: without shared, consistent, and governed memory, agents drift apart in their recommendations, creating confusion and technical debt.

## v2 Opening (180 words, 2 paragraphs)

✅ **More readable** - natural break point

### Paragraph 1: The Scenario (60 words)
> Imagine two software developers, Alice and Bob, working in the same repository with AI-powered coding assistants. Alice asks her agent, "What logging format should we use for error handling?" and receives advice to implement structured JSON logs with timestamp fields and severity levels. Ten minutes later, Bob poses the same question to his agent and is told to use traditional printf-style logs with simple string formatting. Both responses are technically correct in general contexts, but the result is inconsistent practices across the codebase.

### Paragraph 2: What This Shows (50 words)
> This scenario illustrates a fundamental challenge in deploying large language model (LLM) agents in multi-agent or team environments: without shared, consistent, and governed memory, agents drift apart in their recommendations. When a third developer reviews the code, they find two conflicting logging approaches with no documentation explaining the team's actual decision—creating confusion and technical debt.

## Why This is Better

1. **Easier to read**: White space between scenario and interpretation
2. **Standard academic style**: Most CS thesis intros use 3-5 sentence opening paragraphs
3. **Better flow**: Scenario → then what it means
4. **Same content**: Zero words changed, just split into 2 paragraphs

---

## Rest of Document

**No other changes** - paragraphs 3-7 are identical in both versions.

---

## Which to Use?

**Recommend v2** - matches typical academic thesis structure better.

But keep v1 as backup! (Already saved in Git)
