## 🎯 **START HERE: FRONTIER.md** ⭐⭐⭐

**📍 [`FRONTIER.md`](./FRONTIER.md) - ALWAYS CHECK THIS FIRST!**

This is your **navigation file** - it points to the LATEST version of every chapter/section.

**Why it exists:**
- I create many files (drafts, revisions, analysis docs)
- FRONTIER.md tells you which file is current
- Look for the **⭐ USE THIS** marker
- Updated every time a new version is created
