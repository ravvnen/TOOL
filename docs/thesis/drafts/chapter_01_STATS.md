## Comparison to Previous Drafts

| Version | Sections | Total Words | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **v1** | 1.1 only | 1,150 words | ❌ Too long for one section |
| **v2** | 1.1 only | 1,150 words | ❌ Too long for one section |
| **COMPLETE** | 1.1-1.4 | 1,092 words | ✅ Correct scope |

## Key Improvements

1. **Correct scope**: Entire Chapter 1, not just 1.1
2. **Tight writing**: Every section is concise, no fluff
3. **Complete**: All 4 required sections included
4. **Balanced**: No section dominates the chapter
5. **Academic style**: Matches typical CS thesis introduction length

## Page Estimate

**1,092 words** ≈ **3-4 pages** (depending on formatting)

Typical academic formatting:
- 12pt font, 1.5 line spacing: ~3 pages
- 11pt font, 1.5 line spacing: ~2.5 pages
- 12pt font, double spacing: ~4 pages

## Next Steps

1. **Read the complete chapter** (`chapter_01_introduction_COMPLETE.md`)
2. **Edit for voice**: Make it sound like YOU
3. **Check details**: Are RQ1-RQ5 accurate? Are H1-H5 thresholds correct?
4. **Get feedback**: Share with advisor
5. **Move to Chapter 2**: Background & Related Work (10-15 pages)

## Notes

- **Much tighter** than v1/v2 drafts (which were section 1.1 only)
- **Appropriate length** for a thesis introduction
- **Leaves room** for detailed content in later chapters (Background, Design, Implementation)
- **All guidance followed**: From `01_introduction.md`
