title TOOL System - End-to-End Flow

skinparam backgroundColor #FEFEFE

actor "User" as USER
participant "Agent.UI" as UI
participant "TOOL API" as API
database "SQLite" as DB
queue "EVENTS" as EVENTS
participant "Promoter" as PROM
queue "DELTAS" as DELTAS
participant "Projector" as PROJ
participant "Ollama" as LLM

== Flow 1: Rule Ingestion (from GitHub or Admin) ==

API -> EVENTS : Publish EVENT
EVENTS -> PROM : Deliver
PROM -> PROM : Validate
PROM -> DELTAS : Publish DELTA
DELTAS -> PROJ : Deliver
PROJ -> DB : UPSERT rule

note over EVENTS, DELTAS
  Event Sourcing:
  EVENTS = all proposed changes
  DELTAS = approved changes only
end note

== Flow 2: User Chat (with Rule Injection) ==

USER -> UI : Ask question
UI -> API : POST /compile-memory
API -> DB : FTS5 search
DB --> API : Relevant rules
API --> UI : Compiled memory JSON

UI -> LLM : Send prompt + rules
LLM --> UI : Response with citations

UI --> USER : Answer: "... [im:rule.id@v3]"

note over UI, LLM
  Key: TOOL compiles memory,
  Agent.UI calls LLM directly
end note

== Flow 3: Replay Verification (H3) ==

USER -> UI : Click "Replay"
UI -> API : POST /admin/replay
API -> DELTAS : Read from seq 1
API -> API : Rebuild state in temp DB
API -> API : Compute hash
API --> UI : {hash, count}

UI -> API : GET /state
API --> UI : {current hash}

UI -> UI : Compare hashes
UI --> USER : "SRA = 100% ✓"

note over API
  Proves determinism:
  same DELTAs = same state
end note
